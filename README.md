### Modifications made: 
#### 18/10/24
- Change title to be more specific to Vijkra instead of Barkaby and Kallhäll: 
  - “Optimizing Public Transport in Suburban Areas: Assessing the Impact of AI-Driven Call-Based Multimodal Transit Solutions on Emission Reduction and Efficiency Improvement in viksjö.”
  - "AI-Driven Multimodal Transit Solutions for Emission Reduction and Efficiency in Vikja's Public Transport System."
- Narrowed down my research questions to 2 questions.
- Examples now divided them into 2 categories, International and Swedish Context.
- Chosen perspective: Solution based approach but don't need to jump into this.
